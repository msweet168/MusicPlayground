#Music Playground 

##Created by Mitchell Sweet

###This playground was created for a WWDC 17 Scholarship submission 

##Description: 

Music Playground is an interactive Swift playground for creating simple beats. 

Circles are melody, squares are bass, and rectangles are drums. Select a shape, add it to the playground, and it will start bouncing. Add barriers by selecting the barrier object and dragging a line with your finger or trackpad. Each time a shape hits a wall or barrier, it will play its sound. Add multiple shapes and barriers to make cool beats. 

##Frameworks:

Music Playground was created with SpriteKit. User Interface elements were created with UIKit. Graphics were created with Sketch.
